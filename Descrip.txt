"A Lotta Noise" by Robert Rayment:(UPDATE2 Cycle speed added) (UPDATE with faster linear Perlin & Marble) This is a demonstration of 32-bit StretchDIBits which can be run as VB code or VB + machine code.  Perlin noise (Linear or Cosine-EASE), wood grain and marble surfaces can be designed on a picture box varying from 16x16 to 768x512 pixels.  Color weighting, scales, wood and marble types, animated scales and color cyling can be done and the image saved, as a BMP, at any point. The prog can be run with any system color setting.  A long integer graphic surface has the advantage in that it can more easily be dealt with using MMX.  This demo is just the 'tip of the iceberg' but the method might be useful for designing textures for any application since the machine code is quite general and the bin file can be run locally.
